          "question": "Explain what Binary/Data Representation means and why computers use only 0s and 1s to store all information.",
          "answer": "Binary representation encodes data using two states (0 and 1) corresponding to 'off' and 'on' electrical signals.",
          "details": "Computers use binary because it is electrically reliable and less prone to noise than systems with multiple voltage levels. This simplicity allows transistors to act as fast, reliable switches.",

          "answer": "Boolean Algebra is a branch of mathematics where variable values are truth values (1/True, 0/False).",
          "details": "It provides the mathematical foundation for analyzing and simplifying digital circuits. The three fundamental operations are AND, OR, and NOT.",

          "answer": "A Truth Table is a mathematical table showing every possible output for every possible combination of inputs.",
          "details": "It is used to verify a gate's behavior by listing all $2^n$ input combinations (e.g., 00, 01, 10, 11 for a 2-input gate) and their resulting output.",

          "question": "Explain the difference between AND Gates and OR Gates in terms of their output behavior.",
          "answer": "An AND gate outputs 1 only if all inputs are 1; an OR gate outputs 1 if at least one input is 1.",
          "details": "The AND gate represents a series requirement (both must be true), while the OR gate represents a parallel possibility (either can be true).",

          "question": "What are transistors and why were they a major improvement over vacuum tubes in computer development?",
          "answer": "Transistors are semiconductor switches; they improved computers by being smaller, more reliable, and more energy-efficient than vacuum tubes.",
          "details": "Unlike vacuum tubes, transistors do not require a filament to heat up, meaning they produce less heat and have a much longer lifespan, allowing for the miniaturization of processors.",

          "question": "Explain the fundamental difference between Simple Combinational Circuits and Simple Sequential Circuits in terms of memory and timing.",
          "answer": "Combinational circuits depend only on current inputs; sequential circuits depend on current inputs and past states (memory).",
          "details": "Combinational logic (like an adder) has no memory. Sequential logic (like a counter) uses flip-flops and a clock signal to store and track states over time.",

          "answer": "Physical limitations are material constraints preventing infinite speed; two specific constraints are heat dissipation and propagation delay.",
          "details": "Heat dissipation limits how much power can be used before components melt, while propagation delay is the finite time required for a signal to travel through a wire or gate.",

          "question": "Explain what Clock/Timing refers to in digital systems and why synchronization is important for circuit operation.",
          "answer": "The clock is a steady pulse that synchronizes circuit actions; synchronization ensures all data is stable before the next operation begins.",
          "details": "Without a clock, signals arriving at different times (due to varying wire lengths) could cause 'glitches' or incorrect calculations in complex circuits.",

          "question": "Describe what flip-flops are and explain how they differ from basic logic gates in terms of storing information.",
          "answer": "Flip-flops are 1-bit memory elements that maintain a stable state; they differ from gates by using feedback to 'remember' data.",
          "details": "Logic gates only process data immediately; flip-flops capture and hold that data until the next clock pulse, forming the basis of registers and RAM.",
